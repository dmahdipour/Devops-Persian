### Choose distribution by:
* Who is using
* How many users using
### Use Virtual Box

* It is better to separate / *(LVM)*, /boot *(non-LVM)* and /var *(LVM)* as partitions -> avoid side-effects  -> *LVM* can be extended in feature
### Professional approach
Install and Config then create a template or a clone of it. Even automate environment setup.
