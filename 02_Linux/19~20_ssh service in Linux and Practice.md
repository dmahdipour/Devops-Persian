3 methods to communicate with running applications in servers by sockets:
1) *Internet*(Stream Socket):
	1) **TCP** -> http, ftp ,etc
	2) **UDP** -> DNS, NTP, Unix domain Socket
2) *Network Sockets*
3) *Server Sockets*:
	1) **RDP**
	2) **SSH** -> Transfer file, Execute commands, Tunnel, etc.
### Create SSH-KEY
More secure way: Create ssh key for connecting without password. Use Private Key for connections. Public key can be regenerated by private one.
**Note:** All the public keys were stored in <u>/home/USERNAME/.ssh/authorized_keys</u>

To make ssh connection more secure:
* use passphrase 
* change default ssh-port
* If you want to bane unauthorized people, keep Password for login enabled
* restrict special user or group to access ssh 
* disable x-forward
* PermitRootLogin -> yes, without-password, prohibit-password
* AllowGroups groupname
* AllowUsers username
* use ssh banner to inform people that login without permission (hackers)
* ...

**Generate SSH key**:
```shell
ssh-keygen #Passphrase can be set for more security
# id_rsa file is private key
# id_rsa.pub file is public key
```

**Change SSH config and confirm it:**
```
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sshd -t # Check ssh config 
systemctl restart ssh.service
```

**Connect by SSH:**
```shell
ssh user@ip -p port-number
```

**Note:** if open ssh is not available, install it by:
```shell
sudo apt install openssh-server
```
### Transfer file between local and server
We can use ssh for it. It encrypts files.
```shell
scp UserName@IP:/SOURCE DESTINATION #From Server to Local
scp SOURCE UserName@IP:/DESTINATION #From Local to Server
```
