### Linux support Virtual Memory
What ever does not need, move hem from memory to hard and move them back when they will be needed.
Advantages: **More efficient usage of memory. Cheaper than physical memory.**
Disadvantage: **Not quick as physical memory and is limited. Not accessible from CPU directly.**

### Virtual Memory vs Swap
Swap is a disk that when memory will be full, it can be used.

### Virtualization
Separate hardware sources and part them in where we need. Then we can install multi OS by Hypervisors (Instance).:
* Cloud (AWS, Arvan)
* Hardware Directly (Esxi)
* On OS (Virtual box)
