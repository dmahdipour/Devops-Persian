### Devops is a culture for:
standardizing from development to Deployment by a cycle of:
* Getting feedback from output
* Improving them
* Passing them as inputs
### Old approach:
* Multi teams made responsibility problem. Who was responsible:
	* development
	* test
	* release
	* operation
* Don't touch any things are working till down.
* No Documenting
* No team Working
* No optimized output
* Just keep system up and increase uptime.
* No one for getting documents, audit them then validate.
### New approach as Devops helps to:
* Improve teamwork 
* Whole team is responsible for problems
